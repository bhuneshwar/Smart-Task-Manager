# Smart Task Manager

## Overview

The Smart Task Manager is a full-stack application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It incorporates both traditional username/password authentication and OAuth2 authentication (e.g., Google login). The application features task creation, management, and collaboration tools, along with AI-powered suggestions and analytics.

## Features

### Core Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization**
  - Secure login systems using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user sessions.
  - Role-based access control to manage different user permissions.
  - Support for both traditional login and OAuth2 (Google) login.

- **Task Creation and Management**
  - Users can create, edit, and delete tasks with deadlines, priorities, and categories.
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for task organization (to be implemented).

- **AI-Powered Features**
  - Smart suggestions for task prioritization based on user behavior (to be implemented).
  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) for task creation using natural language input (to be implemented).

- **Collaboration Tools**
  - Real-time collaboration features allowing multiple users to work on tasks simultaneously (to be implemented).
  - Commenting system for discussions on specific tasks (to be implemented).

- **Analytics Dashboard**
  - Visualize productivity metrics using charts and graphs (to be implemented).
  - AI-driven insights to suggest improvements in time management (to be implemented).

- **Responsive Design**
  - Mobile-friendly UI built using React.js or Vue.js.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
